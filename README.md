# Layout Model Wrappers

This repository is meant to contain several layout models, each with its own wrapper code. The purpose of these wrappers is to provide a unified way to use the layout models through a common parameter interface.

The layout models are included as submodules from the original authorsâ€™ repositories. The implemented layout models, as well as upcoming ones, are listed as follows
