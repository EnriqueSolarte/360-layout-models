# Layout Models

This repository contents the layout models wrappers. The idea of these wrappers is to provide a simple way to use the layout models in your projects using a standard interface.
In theory, you should be able to use any layout model with any solver, but in practice, some combinations may not work.

## Installation

```sh 
git clone git@github.com:EnriqueSolarte/layout_models.git
cd layout_models
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

## Versions
